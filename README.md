check-mikrotik
==============


This is  little script using the snmpwalk to get the data. 

This script has a cfg file with the mibs of the mikrotik. 

When you call the mem the script gets the mib on this cfg and send this results to your Nagios. 

I believe I will publish a RC on the next five or six days.
